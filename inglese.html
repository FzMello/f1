Formula 1, in acronym F1, in English Formula One and indicated in Italian as Formula One, is the highest category of single-seater cars in
uncovered racing wheels on a circuit defined by the International Automobile Federation (FIA). <br>
The category & egrave; born in 1948 (sort of Formula A, in turn only two years earlier, in 1946), then becoming a
global character in the 1950 season. Initially defined by the International Sports Commission (CSI) of the International Association
of the Recognized Automobile Clubs (AIACR), forerunner association of the International Automobile Federation, today Formula One is
regulated by the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) of the FIA. <br>
The term "formula", present in the name, refers to a set of rules under which all participants, cars and drivers,
they must adapt; they introduce a number of restrictions and specifications in cars, in order to avoid excessive technical disparities between cars,
to set limits on their development and to reduce the risk of accidents. The formula has undergone many changes throughout its history. For example, there
were different types of engines, with schemes from four to sixteen cylinders and with displacements from 1.5 to 4.5 liters.
The competition is owned and organized by the Formula One Group controlled by Liberty Media. <br> <br>
From racing in the late nineteenth century to the birth of Formula 1 <br> <br>
Starting line up at the Monza racetrack for the 1925 Milan Fair Cup, held according to the Formula Grand Prix regulations.
Formula 1 has its roots in the motor racing of the late nineteenth century, which began to assume the status of Grand Prix from 1906.
In the twenties of the twentieth century there was the first serious regulation of racing, called "Formula Grand Prix", and it was adopted mainly in Europe.
This regulation was the basis for three editions of a World Constructors' Championship (won by Alfa Romeo in 1925, by Bugatti in 1926 and by
Delage in 1927), of two editions of an "International Championship" (in 1931 victory of Minoia over Alfa, and in 1932 victory of Tazio Nuvolari over Alfa Romeo)
and the five editions of a "European Grand Prix Championship" (from 1935 to 1939) dominated by German drivers and cars.In 1946 it was baptized with the name of "Formula A", with which a first series of Grand Prix not valid for the title were disputed. They were admitted
two types of engines competing: the 1.5-liter super-compressed and the 4.5-liter aspirated, while in the years preceding the Second World War, they were
allowed
only super-tablets of any capacity until 1938, after which there was the limitation to 3.0 liters. The first race held with this new one
settlement took place on 1 September 1946 in Turin; the Turin Grand Prix, on the Valentino circuit of the homonymous park, which was won by Achille Varzi
driving an Alfa Romeo 158. <br>
Two days later, the "Brezzi Cup" took place on the same track during which Nuvolari, at the wheel of the rookie Cisitalia D46, thrilled the
public making a couple of laps without a steering wheel (which was broken), holding on to the steering column. The Turin house also prepared a revolutionary
1500 cc turbocharged rear-engined car, designed by Ferdinand Porsche, who was credited with an astonishing top speed of 350 km / h;
with it, Nuvolari cherished the dream of participating in the World Motoring Championship, which began to be talked about in 1947.
Bernd Rosemeyer's Auto Union Type C at the NÃ¼rburgring Nordschleife in the 1937 German Grand Prix valid for the European Grand Prix Championship.
The following year the name of the formula was changed to the current one due to the birth of Formula 2. In 1949 seven valid Grand Prix were chosen.
for the award of the trophy. Meanwhile, Varzi had died on the Bern circuit and Nuvolari, ill, could no longer get back on track, while the adventure
of the Cisitalia shipwrecked for lack of funds. On the scene of 1950 many new names appeared, which took the place of the pre-war axes.Juan Manuel 
Fangio immediately showed off, who on 10 April won the Pau Grand Prix on a Maserati.
A month later, the first race valid for the championship took place, the 1950 British Grand Prix. The drivers 'title was followed by a constructors' title.
in 1958. For the first two years, racing for Formula One cars was not organized in a championship; however, they immediately took on the name of
"Grand Prix" and had international importance (they were organized in various European countries). In 1950 the first World Championship was organized
of Formula 1, so called even if in fact it took place at a European level, which was won by Nino Farina aboard an Alfa Romeo 158; in the calendar
the Indianapolis 500 was also included in this first edition, but none of the drivers and teams involved in the other races of the world
disputed it. <br>
Over the decades, nationally important championships have also been organized for Formula One cars (for example the South African and the British
Formula One Series which took place between 1978 and 1982 in the United Kingdom) and until 1983 there were also many Grand Prix races not valid for
 a championship.
Currently, however, the Formula One cars compete exclusively in the world championship, organized annually by the Federation
International of the Automobile, always disputed from 1950 to today and unanimously considered the maximum expression of modern motoring.
Each decade has had its own fairly precise physiognomy: front-engined cars dominated in the 1950s; in the sixties that a
rear engine, without ailerons; in the seventies there was a great development of the aerodynamics of the Formula 1 car; the eighties 
 were characterized by turbo engines; the nineties from electronics; from the 2000s onwards, from the competition between the major car manufacturers.
